# Auditing-and-Compliance-for-Online-Banking-System
The goal of this project is to implement auditing and compliance measures in an online banking system to ensure that user actions are logged for auditing purposes and that the system is in compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
## Requirements
* Implement logging using a suitable logging framework, such as Log4j or Logback.
* Configure the logging framework to log all user actions, such as login attempts, account accesses, and transactions.
* Review the logs regularly to ensure that the system is in compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
* Set up alerts or notifications for certain types of events, such as suspicious activity or potential security breaches.
* Implement error handling to ensure that the system can handle potential errors and exceptions in a secure and compliant manner.

## Deliverables
* A functioning online banking system with auditing and compliance measures implemented.
* A report detailing the auditing and compliance measures implemented and the results of the review of the logs.
* A plan for maintaining and updating the auditing and compliance measures in the future.
